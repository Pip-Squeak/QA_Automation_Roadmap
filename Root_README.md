# My Programming Roadmap

This repo is my personal learning roadmap for Python and development. It is divided into three phases:

- [Phase 1 – Basics](Phase1_Basics/README.md)
- [Phase 2 – Intermediate](Phase2_Intermediate/README.md)
- [Phase 3 – Advanced](Phase3_Advanced/README.md)
- [Resources](resources/README.md)

Each phase contains exercises and projects to practice the concepts.
